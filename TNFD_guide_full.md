Metrics used by the organisation to assess and manage material nature-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process

# Description
Metrics and Targets Recommended Disclosure a) Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess and manage material nature-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.

# Details
An organisation should disclose the indicators and metrics used to measure and manage the material nature-related risks and opportunities described in Strategy A.

To achieve this, an organisation should disclose the metrics that are most relevant to and most accurately represent the nature-related risks and opportunities on which it is reporting. The metrics disclosed should include:

All core global and core sector risk and opportunity metrics listed in Annex 1 reported at the organisational level; and

Any other relevant metrics, drawing on the TNFD additional disclosure indicators and metrics listed in Annex 2 and the organisation’s own assessment metrics as appropriate, reported at the appropriate organisational level (e.g. site, product, service, region or organisation) to reflect most accurately the magnitude of risks and opportunities described in Strategy A.

Where possible, these should cover:

Financial information about the effects of nature-related risks and opportunities on the organisation, with reference to effects reported in Strategy B; and

Insight into how the organisation monitors actions, policies and strategies to manage risks and opportunities, with reference to Strategy B and Risk and Impact Management B.

Indicators and metrics should also be disclosed for historical periods, including prior year comparisons to allow for trend analysis. When appropriate, the organisation should disclose forward-looking nature-related indicators and metrics, consistent with its business or strategic planning time horizons.

The organisation should describe the methodologies and assumptions used to calculate or estimate nature-related indicators and metrics, including any limitations. 

An organisation should provide a short explanation where any core metrics are not reported. A core metric may be omitted where it has:

Not been identified as relevant or material to the organisation; or

Been identified as relevant and material, but the organisation is unable to measure it due to limitations with methodologies or access to data. In this case, organisations should explain how they plan to address this in future reporting periods.

Metrics used by the organisation to assess and manage dependencies and impacts on nature.

# Description
Metrics and Targets Recommended Disclosure b) Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess and manage dependencies and impacts on nature.

# Details
The organisation should disclose the indicators and metrics used to measure and manage the material nature-related dependencies and impacts described in Strategy A.

To achieve this, an organisation should disclose the metrics that are most relevant to and most accurately represent the nature-related dependencies and impacts on which it is reporting. This should include, for each dependency and impact described in Strategy A:

All core global and core sector metrics for dependencies and impacts listed in Annex 4 and in relevant sector guidance; and

Any other relevant metrics, drawing on the TNFD additional disclosure indicators and metrics listed in Annex 2 and the organisation’s own assessment metrics as appropriate.

These metrics should cover the organisation’s impact drivers associated with each material dependency and impact identified in Strategy A, indicating what the impact driver is (i.e. the type of pollutant emitted), the magnitude (i.e. the quantity of pollutant) and the location in which the impact driver occurs, with reference to Strategy D. It is also recommended that the organisation consider covering in its disclosure, for the location of each dependency and impact described in Strategy A, with reference to Strategy D:

Other elements of the dependency and impact pathway (qualitatively if quantitative metrics are not yet available) including:

Changes in the state of nature (e.g. ecosystem condition and extent, and species population size and extinction risk); and

Changes in the availability of ecosystem services;

Actions, policies and strategies to manage these impacts and dependencies, as disclosed in Strategy B; and

Aggregated impact drivers for the organisation’s direct operations, and upstream and downstream value chain(s) to the extent possible, and by product or service line if material, using the core global and core sector metrics listed in Annex 1 and in relevant sector guidance. Where organisations are not able to report metrics for the full value chain, organisations are encouraged to report metrics at the stage of the value chain that is most representative of their material nature-related issues. For metrics focused on the use of natural commodities, this is likely to require reporting on upstream activities.

An organisation should provide a short explanation where any core metrics are not reported explaining whether it has:

Not been identified as relevant or material to the organisation; or

Been identified as relevant and material, but the organisation is unable to measure it due to limitations with methodologies or access to data. In this case, organisations should explain how they plan to address this in future reporting periods.

Metrics should be reported:

Against a clear and transparent baseline and/or reference condition where possible;

Separately for negative and positive impacts, not on a net basis;

With reference to whether they relate to the organisation’s direct operations, upstream value chain(s) or downstream value chain(s);

With an absolute figure, the rate of change, and an intensity/efficiency ratio. The TNFD disclosure metrics contained with Annexes 1 and 2 are mostly listed at the absolute level. Organisations are encouraged to use the best practice intensity/efficiency ratios for their sectors, describing the rationale for selection of ratios.

The organisation should also disclose:

If and how metrics have been aggregated, in line with general requirement and including the scientific justification for aggregating metrics and/or locations (e.g. ecological equivalency or industry best practice with references), the methodologies used and any limitations or assumptions;

A description of the methodologies, tools and data platforms used to obtain key data; the assumptions, tools and data platforms used to calculate or estimate nature-related indicators and metrics; and any limitations, including a lack of data or the use of proxy data and industry averages; and

When appropriate, forward-looking nature-related indicators and metrics, consistent with its business or strategic planning time horizons.
