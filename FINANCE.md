Institutional investor
best practice by 2025
Embracing an implementation platform designed
to lower costs and improve outcomes
Russell Investments Research

Travis Bagley, CFA, Director, Transition Management

What will implementation for institutional investors look like in 2025? The investment
management industry has witnessed dramatic change over the last five years and significant
industry shifts continue to drive change in how institutional investors approach the management
of their investment programs. Between now and 2025, we don’t expect the investment
opportunity set to expand materially, but we do expect how investors approach the overall
management of their investment portfolios to evolve significantly. This new era will be driven
both by asset owners’ increased focus on fees and costs and the innovations investment firms
are harnessing to help these asset owners seek improved risk adjusted returns at lower costs.
Over the coming year, we’re going to explore these shifts and evaluate how an implementation
platform can help institutional investor improve outcomes.
Broadening the notion of incremental return
One of the questions asset owners are beginning to ask is: Are all return strategies of equal
value? Is a cost savings tactic that is certain to save 10 basis points of fees equivalent in value
to an alpha strategy that has the potential to add 10 basis points of return? We believe
“certain” can contribute more value to your investment program than “potential,” and the
additional return created from judicious and prudent implementation is an often-overlooked
facet of asset management that can add real value for investors. The benefits of careful
implementation of investment portfolios can help investors achieve their goals with new focus
and a modest change in process. This paper examines strategies investors can employ to
improve their outcomes with modest changes in process – a clear focus on fee mitigation and
transaction cost management.

1. Maximize fee budgets by 2025
   Today’s institutional investor has a syndicate of different service providers, each providing
   disparate services at varying costs. Sub-adviser fees are generally the largest explicit cost for
   an investor and make up roughly 50% of the total costs associated with managing a large pool
   of assets.1 In absolute terms, the resulting ratio of excess return to fees puts stress on risk
   adjusted net of fee outcomes at the total fund level for even very well-run portfolios.

Negotiating down asset manager fees is important to cost control; however, it’s not the only
strategy available to investors. Investors should also consciously allocate their finite fee
budgets to the most attractive risk adjusted net of fee investment strategies. This will allow
investors to work with the active management community to shift their focus to adding value
over time by working with them to build high conviction/high active share portfolios, avoid
overdiversification, construct more efficient RFPs, etc. In 2025, investors will have low-fee
passive mandates for exposures they believe will not have profitable alpha and will have
concentrated, high conviction mandates in areas where they see alpha opportunities.

2. Accelerated mandate changes by 2025
   Identifying better investment opportunities is one of the most essential parts of the investment
   process. Once these opportunities are uncovered, investors must pay the price (aka.
   transaction costs) to move assets to healthier investment strategies. Transaction costs account
   for approximately 25% of the total cost investors are paying to manage their investment
   portfolios according to the CEM study.11 Mismanaged portfolio transitions can be very costly
   for large institutions, and therefore institutional investors have embraced specialist transition
   managers to minimize the transaction costs and manage transition risk for decades. Employing
   a transition manager almost certainly delivers better results than having disparate asset
   managers attempt to manage transitions across mandates. But with a deeper examination of
   the change process, we have learned that in nearly all cases, institutional investors have had a
   significant delay between the decision to terminate a mandate and the actual reallocation to a
   new mandate. During this interim juncture between decision and implementation, investors
   default to allowing the legacy manager to continue managing the assets until a new manager
   is identified and contracted. This procedural delay detains investor portfolios in out-of-favor
   strategies, while manager fees and transaction costs for this strategy continue to accrue.
   We believe a better solution is to terminate the legacy strategy immediately after the decision
   to remove the legacy mandate is made and put the portfolio into a lower risk hibernation state
   with the help of an interim portfolio manager. Historically, investors have transitioned portfolios
   to index mandates in this interim period to minimize risk, but this is an expensive solution from
   a transaction cost perspective – requiring the investor to transition from active to passive, then
   back to active once a new manager is identified. Alternatively, using a custom interim portfolio
   management strategy can help optimize the portfolio to reduce tracking error to the
   benchmark, while preserving certain intended factor exposures and minimizing turnover and
   transaction costs. These interim management strategies prove to be less costly than
   completely restructuring a portfolio to an index and then transitioning from the index back to a
   new active mandate. The interim management strategy also provides fee savings, as the
   interim management fees are significantly lower than the average active manager fees. With
   lower transaction costs and manager fees, the interim strategy can be a better solution than
   the ‘delay until the new manager is ready’ paradigm most investor use today. 3. Centralized implementation by 2025
   Portfolio implementation has traditionally been delegated to sub-advisors, each with their own
   unique implementation process. Large institutional investors nearly always employ multiple
   sub-advisors to provide them with a diverse set of investment strategies. As a result, in most
   instances each sub-advisor operates in a silo, without transparency to the larger total portfolio
   experience. This myopic approach creates redundancies in the implementation process and
   adds significant costs to the investor. Historically, there has been a lack of transparency to the
   implementation costs from sub-advisors and thus investors cannot manage costs they cannot
   observe. For example, currency trading cost became a focus in the industry after several court
   cases2 demonstrated that foreign currency trading for pension plans was much costlier than
   generally reported. Historically, many asset managers have put low priority on currency
   trading, considering it outside of explicit performance reporting requirements, and only an
   operational task to settle underlying security trades. With investors more focused on costs, this
   historic view is changing, and the industry has responded with foreign currency trading cost
   analysis and a shift from principal to centralized agency foreign exchange providers to manage
   currency execution and minimize costs.

Currency trading is only a piece of the transaction cost equation and investors are becoming
increasingly savvy to cost minimization strategies through effective implementation. A new
innovative approach to portfolio implementation – Portfolio Emulation (or Enhanced Portfolio
Implementation) – is gaining traction now and we anticipate it will be the best-practice
approach for managing multi-manager portfolios by 2025. Portfolio emulation is designed to
reduce transaction costs and sub-advisor fees, while providing more transparency to the
implementation costs of each investment strategy. Portfolio emulation is rapidly gaining market
acceptance as the optimal approach for implementing multi-manager mandates. This approach
offers a fundamentally new method of multi-manager composite construction that shifts
implementation from the manager level to the composite level through centralizing trading
responsibility at a single point – and you can read more about it in our Portfolio Emulation
paper.

Fees
Asset manager fees will continue to be a focus for investors and best practice
will seek to maximize the value of manager fee budgets, hire high conviction
managers for active mandates to avoid over diversification and get the most
‘bang for their investment buck.’

Interim portfolio management
The use of interim portfolio management as a tool to accelerate mandate
change, reduce transaction costs and lower management fees will play an
increasingly larger role in managing portfolio changes.

Centralized portfolio implementation
Centralizing portfolio implementation and unifying currently disparate trading
functions will fundamentally change how institutional investors approach
portfolio management, by lowering transaction costs and management fees,
while providing more control over portfolio assembly and management.
Structural changes to implementation such as Agency FX and Portfolio
Emulation are already in motion and as investors observe the improved
outcomes from these implementation constructs, they will migrate to
implementation platforms for incremental return. (See Portfolio emulation
paper & Agency FX case study)

Conclusion
Regardless of what the future holds, we can be confident that investors will continue to seek to
improve their investment outcomes. We believe better implementation will be an increasingly
important theme in the years to come. Better implementation helps provide efficiencies,
transparency and explicit focus that create genuine cost savings, which should improve return
with more certainty than relying solely on the alpha strategies provided by the investment
industry. Although implementation services are available to investors today, how they are
consumed will be the key difference in the future. In 2025, investors will seek out integrated
implementation platforms providing a collective set of capabilities rather than disparate
services patched together to accomplish stand-alone investment goals. Investors will also look
for firms offering a single implementation engine, which leverages capabilities in portfolio
management, risk management and trading, combined with consultative strategy and
operational scale. The combination of these capabilities is what creates a powerful
implementation platform.
While the implementation platform has the potential to lower costs and reduce risk, its biggest
benefit could be the shift of many operational burdens from the investor to the implementation
platform partner. Investors want more time to focus on researching alpha strategies. Having
access to a platform that holistically manages implementation has the added benefit of
reducing the resources institutional investors need to manage their investment operations – as
illustrated in Exhibit 1.
Exhibit 1: Institutional investor resource allocation with implementation platform

As 2025 approaches, large institutional investors will broaden their notion of incremental return
to include cost savings from implementation efficiency. We believe the certainty of return from
cost savings will drive investors to embrace the type of implementation platform we describe in
this paper to improve investment outcomes. Today, investors should consider beginning
adopting the best practice of finding an implementation partner with a platform to reduce
implementation costs and fees in the future. The right implementation platform partner can
help provide incremental return that is more certain than almost any other strategy, while
improving control and reducing operational burden for institutional investors.
